Smart Campus Navigator - Progress Report and planning 
--------------------------------------------------

Project Overview:
This project implements a Smart Campus Navigator tool to help CSUF students:
- Find the shortest path between buildings
- Search for buildings by name
- Interact with a clean and simple GUI

The system uses classic algorithms such as Dijkstra's for shortest path and KMP for efficient string matching.

Completed Components (as of May 1):

Backend Logic:
- Campus graph built with weighted edges 
- Dijkstra’s algorithm implemented to compute shortest paths 
- KMP algorithm used to search for building names

GUI (Tkinter-based) 1st Iteration:
- Dropdown menus for start and end buildings (
- Search bar to find building names
- Results display with shortest path and distance
- Input validation included

GUI (PYQT5-based) 2nd Iteration:
- Basic text boxes for task input and task list
- side box for campus map with nodes

Development Progress Timeline:
April 28:
- GitHub repo set up, campus map layout drafted, libraries reviewed

April 29:
- Backend Dijkstra and string matching feature planning started

April 30:
- GUI with navigation buttons implemented, Dijkstra connected to GUI

May 1:
- KMP search tested, GUI layout improved, input validation added

Next Steps:
- Display task scheduling using Activity Selection (Greedy Algorithm)
- Add result output formatting for better user readability
- Final GUI polishing and bug testing
- Package application for final submission with documentation and screenshots
